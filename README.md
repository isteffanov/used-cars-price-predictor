## Things we haven't done yet

    - More statistical approach to detecting and removing outliers
    - Trying more sophisticated algorithms
    - Fully utilize the model_name feature; our guess it it will be a lot of help
    - Add np.random.seed to the training and splitting scripts so that we get consistent results every time
